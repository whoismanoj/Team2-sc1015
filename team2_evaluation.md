My observations:
  - The problem formulation is just good enough. I noticed only one problem to be solved.
  - drop some columns, remove the null values, removing outliers etc.
  - EDA courses created, includes course price analysis, course rating etc.
  - k-prototypes implemented as machine learning part
  - presentation is good enough!
  - you could have leart more if you had more problmes to be solved
